Section 1 -Task2

To migrate the existing on-premises system, several components can be migrated to the cloud using appropriate service models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

1. Web Application (Monolithic) – IaaS
   
The monolithic web application currently hosted on physical servers can be migrated to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) by deploying it on cloud virtual machines.

3. Backend SQL Database – PaaS
The on-premises SQL database server can be migrated to a PaaS-based managed database service.

4. File Storage (Local File System) – PaaS
Local file storage can be replaced with PaaS cloud-managed storage services.

5. Networking Components – IaaS
Physical routers, firewalls, and network configurations can be migrated to IaaS networking services.

6. Email Services – SaaS
On-premises email servers used for client notifications can be migrated to Software as a Service (SaaS) email platforms.
