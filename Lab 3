This assignment analyzes a mid-sized retail company's on-premises IT infrastructure and proposes strategies for migrating to the cloud. It examines key components such as the web application, database, file storage, networking, and email services, identifying which can be moved to IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. The goal is to design a migration plan that minimizes risk, ensures business continuity, and leverages cloud capabilities for scalability, reliability, and reduced operational overhead.
